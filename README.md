# Realatia

> A comprehensive real estate networking and business management platform built
> with Domain-Driven Design, Hexagonal Architecture, CQRS, and Event-Driven
> Architecture principles.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The Realatia is designed as a distributed system with 18 distinct bounded
contexts, each responsible for a specific business domain. The platform follows
modern software architecture patterns to ensure scalability, maintainability,
and robust business logic implementation.

### Core Architecture Patterns

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** - Rich domain models with clear business logic
  separation
- **Hexagonal Architecture** - Clean separation between domain, application, and
  infrastructure layers
- **CQRS** - Command Query Responsibility Segregation for optimal read/write
  operations
- **Event-Driven Architecture** - Loose coupling through domain events and
  eventual consistency

17. **🆘 Help & Support** - User assistance and support systems
18. **📚 Tutorial & Onboarding** - User education and guided experiences

## 🏛️ Technical Architecture

### Domain Layer

- **Aggregates** - Business entities with encapsulated business rules
- **Value Objects** - Immutable objects representing business concepts
- **Domain Events** - Cross-context communication and business notifications
- **Domain Services** - Business logic that doesn't naturally fit within
  entities

### Application Layer

- **Command Handlers** - Process business commands and coordinate domain
  operations
- **Query Handlers** - Retrieve and present data for read operations
- **Application Services** - Orchestrate complex business workflows
- **Event Handlers** - React to domain events from other contexts

### Infrastructure Layer

- **Repositories** - Data persistence and retrieval abstractions
- **External Service Adapters** - Integration with third-party services
- **Event Bus** - Reliable event distribution across contexts
- **Database Adapters** - Database-specific implementation details

### Interface Layer

- **REST APIs** - HTTP-based service interfaces
- **GraphQL Endpoints** - Flexible query interfaces for client applications
- **Event Subscribers** - Handle incoming events from other systems
- **Web Controllers** - Handle HTTP requests and responses

## 🔄 Event-Driven Integration

The platform uses domain events for loose coupling between contexts:

### Key Integration Events

- `UserOnboardingCompleted` - Triggers profile setup across multiple contexts
- `BusinessProfileCompleted` - Enables full platform feature access
- `SubscriptionChanged` - Updates feature availability across contexts
- `SecurityEventOccurred` - Triggers security notifications and actions

### Event Flow Examples

```
User Registration → Email Verification → Profile Creation → Chapter Assignment → Analytics Tracking
```

```
Property Inquiry → Notification Creation → Communication Initiation → Analytics Update
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ or .NET 6+
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Redis 6+
- Message Queue (RabbitMQ/Apache Kafka)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/CiprianoPrince/realatia.git

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
dotnet restore

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Run database migrations
npm run migrate
# or
dotnet ef database update

### End-to-End Tests

- Complete user journeys
- Business workflow validation
- Performance testing

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Bounded Context Development

1. **Domain Modeling** - Design aggregates and value objects
2. **Command/Query Definition** - Define operations and data requirements
3. **Event Design** - Plan cross-context communication
4. **Implementation** - Build domain, application, and infrastructure layers
5. **Testing** - Unit, integration, and acceptance tests

### Event-First Development

1. Define domain events for business-critical operations
2. Implement event handlers in consuming contexts
3. Design sagas for complex cross-context workflows
4. Ensure eventual consistency patterns

## 📊 Monitoring and Observability

### Application Metrics

- Business KPIs (user registrations, profile completions, connections)
- Technical metrics (response times, error rates, throughput)
- Event processing statistics

### Logging and Tracing

- Distributed tracing across bounded contexts
- Event sourcing for audit trails

### Health Checks

- Context-specific health endpoints
- Database connectivity monitoring
- External service dependency checks
